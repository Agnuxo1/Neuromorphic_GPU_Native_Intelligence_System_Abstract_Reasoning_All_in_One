# Neuromorphic_GPU_Native_Intelligence_System_Abstract_Reasoning_All_in_One
We present CHIMERA (Cognitive Hybrid Intelligence for Memory-Embedded Reasoning Architecture), a revolutionary neuromorphic computing system that achieves general intelligence capabilities entirely within GPU hardware using OpenGL compute shaders, eliminating all dependencies on external RAM or traditional CPU-based memory hierarchies.
