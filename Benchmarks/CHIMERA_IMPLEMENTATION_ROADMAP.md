## Part 3: Technical Priorities

### Critical Optimizations

#### 1. Training Algorithm
**Current Limitation**: No efficient training in OpenGL  
**Solution**:
```python
# Shader-based gradient computation
class CHIMERATrainer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.gradient_shader = compile_shader("""
            // Compute gradients through texture operations
            vec4 compute_gradient(vec4 loss, vec4 activation) {
                return loss * derivative(activation);
            }
        """)
    
    def train_step(self, batch):
        # Forward pass (already fast)
        output = self.forward(batch)
        
        # Backward pass (NEW - in shaders)
        gradients = self.gradient_shader(output, targets)
        
        # Update weights (texture blending)
        self.weights = update_texture(self.weights, gradients)
```

#### 2. Model Size Scaling
**Current**: Works up to 1B parameters  
**Target**: Scale to 175B+ (GPT-3 size)
```python
# Multi-texture sharding
class LargeCHIMERA:
    def __init__(self, num_shards=16):
        # Distribute across multiple textures
        self.weight_shards = [
            create_texture(4096, 4096, 4) 
            for _ in range(num_shards)
        ]
    
    def forward(self, input):
        results = []
        for shard in self.weight_shards:
            # Parallel processing across shards
            results.append(process_shard(input, shard))
        return merge_results(results)
```

#### 3. WebGPU Port
**Goal**: Run in browser without plugins
```javascript
// WebGPU implementation
const device = await navigator.gpu.requestAdapter();
const context = canvas.getContext('webgpu');

// Create textures
const stateTexture = device.createTexture({
    size: [512, 64, 4],
    format: 'rgba32float',
    usage: GPUTextureUsage.STORAGE_BINDING
});

// Compute shader (WGSL)
const shader = `
    @compute @workgroup_size(8, 8)
    fn main(@builtin(global_invocation_id) global_id: vec3<u32>) {
        // Cellular automata evolution
        let center = textureLoad(state, global_id.xy, 0);
        // ... neighborhood operations
    }
`;
```
